# INTRODUCTION

The idea behind testing is not new. You can’t sleep well if you are not confident that your last commit didn’t take down the whole application. Having your application covered with tests gives you more trust in the stability of your application. That’s all.

代码测试并不是新的东西。如果你无法确保提交的代码不会导致应用程序崩溃，你肯定睡不了一个好觉。只有经过测试的应用程序，你才能更确信应用的稳定性。这就是代码测试。
